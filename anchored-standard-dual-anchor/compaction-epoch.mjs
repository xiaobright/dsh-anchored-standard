/**
 * Epoch-aware promotion tracker shared by the bootstrap and baseline-gate
 * plugins of the anchored presets.
 *
 * A compaction rewrites the model-visible surface: the pre-compaction
 * conversation collapses into one synthetic summary message, and the
 * workspace-instruction baseline is re-injected from scratch. The first
 * post-compaction request is therefore a "second first request" — the same
 * first-token conditions the anchored presets exist to control. Promotion is
 * epoch-aware: only a durable promotion signal (`tool/call` and/or
 * `assistant/message`, per the caller's `promoteEvents`) recorded AFTER the
 * last `compaction/end` boundary counts as promoted. Before any compaction
 * the boundary is -1, which preserves the original one-shot semantics.
 *
 * State is memoized per session id and maintained incrementally through
 * `observe()`; a cold session scans its durable log once (so resume and
 * reload reconstruct the same phase), then O(1).
